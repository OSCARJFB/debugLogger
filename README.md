# debugLogger
This is a project of mine giving som base training of variadic functions in c. 
My goal was to build something like the printf().

The result was a logger, it takes a string argument, and any amount of following arguments which 
are formatted into the string in a similar way of printf(). Example: "Hello %d", 1 = hello 1.
